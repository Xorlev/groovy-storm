# Groovy Storm Starter

## Overview

**groovy-storm** is a starter kit for using Groovy with Nathan Marz's [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) distributed computing framework. Doubtless, there are better ways of doing this, but this hastily hacked together *pom.xml* and ExclamationTopology example will help get a project going.

I'll update this as I learn better ways of doing this. Perhaps even as a leiningen project.

Pull requests are always appreciated.

## Running

Should be easy as:

	$ mvn package
	[INFO] Scanning for projects...
	[INFO]

	etcâ€¦

Output cut for brevity.

## License

Probably Eclipse, given that Storm is Eclipse. I heard lawyers have sharp teeth and wallets like hoovers.
